# Group 303 - Art(ists)(work)

## Project Description
Being the superficial human that I am, I like to look at beautiful things, and luckily, I found an art dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is called _Museum of Modern Art Collection: Title, artist, date, and medium of every artwork in the MoMA collection_, and I am generally interested in the variety of mediums used to create art, but Modern and Contemporary Art is particularly interesting, because it exceeds the expectations and limitations of traditional art through bold experimentations in medium, techinique, and thought. Contemporary art can also be interesting because it questions the definition of 'art', and one can tell much about another by their own definition of 'art'.

I am analyzing topics like
- Nationality of artists
- Age, Birth, and Death of artists
- Gender of Artists in collection
- Most quantities of Classifications
- ratio of each Classification within dataset
- Highest number of artworks acquired through time
  - which Classification supposedly boosted this number

## About the Dataset

My dataset is the Museum of Modern Art's collection that spans over 150 years. This data was collected from MoMA's database 4 years ago, by Abigail Larion with the intention of engaging people in modern art. There are two datasets: Artists and Artworks. The artists have 15092 rows (artists) and notable variables are Nationality, Gender, Birth Year, Death Year. For the Artworks dataset, there are 130263 individual pieces of artwork (columns) and notable variables include Medium, Acquisition Date, Dimensions, size (diameter, circumference, height, width, depth), Classification. The datasets are currently stored in csv files, which will put my newly acquired Excel skills to use.

## Team Members
- Jodi Chan: I am doing a data science minor with a major in computer science. Data science is more flexible in regards to manpower. I can work on projects by myself where as Computer Science projects are always in teams. It's refreshing to have some sense of self-care in the form of individualism.
